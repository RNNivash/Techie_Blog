<h1>About Techie Blog</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Techie Blog – a space dedicated to exploring technology, coding, and data-driven insights.
This project is built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, where I’ve integrated features like user authentication, blog post creation, drafts, comments, and publishing workflows. It’s more than just a blog – it’s a hands-on project that showcases my ability to design, build, and manage a full-stack web application.
Here, you’ll find posts on programming, problem-solving, data analysis, and my journey as I continue to grow in the field of technology. The goal of Techie Blog is not only to share knowledge but also to create a platform that reflects my passion for building meaningful digital solutions.
